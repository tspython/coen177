Step 1 Observations:
     - executes more command for the ls using pipe
Step 2 Observations:
     - program shows reading and writing on upstream/downstream pipe fds[1] vs fds[0]

step 6 observations
    - 10 threads created
    i = {2,5,6,7,4,9}
    problem: is that i is a shared-state memory instead of
step 7:
     fix is to add an array thread_args that will allocate an i for every thread, so that they aren't all using shared-state memory
     Check Lab3_3.c for fixed code.
