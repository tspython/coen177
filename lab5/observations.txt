Step 1: threadSync.c is different than threadHello.c program because all the threads return. Why?

threadSync.c shows how thread synchronization works using semaphores. They control access to the critical section, while threadHello.c just shows how to create and join threads.

thus the i variable that was causing issues in the original implementation of threadHello.c will not cause the same issue here.
